# 5A Invariant Subspaces

### 5.1 Definition: operator
A linear map from a vector space to itself is called an operator.


### 5.2 Definition: invariant subspace
Suppose $T \in L(V)$. A subspace $U$ of $V$ is called invariant under $T$ if $Tu \in U$ for every $u \in U$.


### 5.5 Definition: eigenvalue
Suppose $T \in L(V)$. A number $\lambda \in F$ is called an eigenvalue of $T$ if there exists $v \in V$ such that $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$.


### 5.7
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional, $T \in L(V)$, and $\lambda \in F$. Then the following are equivalent. 

- $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$.
- $T - \lambda I$ is not injective.
- $T - \lambda I$ is not surjective.
- $T - \lambda I$ is not invertible.


### 5.8 Definition: eigenvector
Suppose $T \in L(V)$ and $\lambda \in F$ is an eigenvalue of $T$. A vector $v \in V$ is called an eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ if $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$.


### 5.11 
Suppose $T \in L(V)$. Then every list of eigenvectors of $T$ corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of $T$ is linearly independent.


### 5.12
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then each operator on $V$ has at most $dim V$ distinct eigenvalues.


### 5.13 Notation
Suppose $T \in L(V)$ and $m$ is a positive integer.

- $T^m \in L(V)$ is defined by $T^m = T ... T$ ($m$ times).
- $T^0$ is defined to be the identity operator $I$ on $V$.
- If $T$ is invertible with inverse $T^{-1}$, then $T^{-m} \in L(V)$ is defined by

$$T^{-m} = (T^{-1})^m$$


### 5.14
Suppose $T \in L(V)$ and $p \in P(F)$ is a polynomial given by 

$$p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + ... + a_m z^m$$

for all $z \in F$. Then $p(T)$ is the operator on $V$ defined by

$$p(T) = a_0 I + a_1 T + a_2 T^2 + ... + a_m T^m$$


### 5.16 Definition: product of polynomials
If $p, q \in P(F)$, then $pq \in P(F)$ is the polynomial defined by

$$(pq)(z) = p(z) q(z)$$

for all $z \in F$.


### 5.17
Suppose $p, q \in P(F)$ and $T \in L(V)$. Then

- $(pq)(T) = p(T) q(T)$
- $p(T) q(T) = q(T) p(T)$


### 5.18
Suppose $T \in L(V)$ and $p \in P(F)$. Then $null p(T)$ and $range p(T)$ are invariant under $T$.
